# Titanic-EDA-and-Visualizations

In this task we are going to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the titanic
dataset. The titanic dataset describe the survival status of individual passengers
on the Titanic. The titanic data frame does not contain information from the crew, but it
does contain actual ages of half of the passengers. The principal source for data about
Titanic passengers is the Encyclopedia Titanica. 

The variables on our extracted dataset are pclass, survived, name, age, embarked,
home.dest, room, ticket, boat, and sex. pclass refers to passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd),
and is a proxy for socio-economic class. Age is in years, and some infants had
fractional values.


The purpose for performing an EDA on this dataset is to:
1. maximize insight into a data set
2. uncover underlying structure
3. extract important variables
4. detect outliers and anomalies
5. test underlying assumptions
6. develop parsimonious models
7. determine optimal factor settings
